        <div class="sqitemdetails">
        <strong>Summary:</strong><br>Strong Mage unit capable of damaging and potentially killing multiple enemies across the map with stuns and large damage from her bouncing attacks and Main skill. Works best with other Electrocute units as her own Electrocute is less reliable. <strong><br><br>Pros:</strong><ul><li>Attacks that bounce between up to 7 targets lets her hit enemies in the front and backlines simultaneously.</li><li>High attack speed lets her get in multiple hits and chances for Electrocute and stun on enemies.</li><li>Big damage on Main Skill that can hit enemies anywhere on the map as long as they're Electrocuted.</li></ul><strong>Cons:</strong><ul><li>Her own Electrocute is RNG dependent, so she's reliant on other Electocute units to apply it more consistently for her (investment needed).</li></ul><strong>Pairs well with:</strong><ul><li><strong>Electrocute:</strong>Thor, Hermes, Thundershot, etc. can apply Electrocute to different parts of the map, making her less dependent on applying her own Electrocute and allowing her to hit more enemies with her main skill.</li></ul><strong>Does poorly against:</strong><ul><li><strong>Stun Immunity:</strong>While units immune to Stun can still be Electrocuted, this can still hamper her utility.</li><li><strong>Multi-population:</strong>Multi-population units can eat the bounce on her attacks, making it more difficult to hit other priority targets.</li><li><strong>Assassins: </strong>Can remove her before she causes much trouble.</li></ul>

        </div>
        <div class="sqitemdetails">
        <strong>Summary:</strong><br>The only unit available that can continuously spawn minions. This can make him the most important unit in some Giant Hunt events and certain lineups where the enemy army lacks area-of-effect damage abilities. Any kind of unit that has an AoE however will quickly demolish Necromancer's rats and lower his overall usefulness. <strong><br><br>Pros:</strong><ul><li>Can constantly summon minions that, while weak, can stall out units that can only attack single targets if they can't kill them faster than Necromancer Rat can produce them.</li><li>Fantastic unit in many Giant Hunt events where the boss is only capable of killing one unit at a time, such as Oni Warrior.</li></ul><strong>Cons:</strong><ul><li>Low range for a Mage puts him close to the front line and closer in range to dangerous attacks from units like Elemental Witch and Storm.</li><li>Can't do much if his rats get overrun quickly.</li><li>Generally a weak unit for Ancients since bosses have large attacks that can clear all summoned rats.</li></ul><strong>Pairs well with:</strong><ul><li><strong>Battle Drummer:</strong>Boosts all of the rats, granting them extra damage.</li><li><strong>Taunt:</strong>Taunt users can keep enemies off the rats, allowing them to live longer.</li></ul><strong>Does poorly against:</strong><ul><li><strong>Area of Effect: </strong>Werewolf, Swashbuckler, and several other units can throw out attacks that kill all nearby rats. Werewolf especially can get stronger off each rat killed.</li></ul>

        <div class="sqitemthumb"><img src="images/units/Dakini.png" alt=""><h3>Dakini</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="sqitemdetails">
        <strong>Summary:</strong><br>A melee unit with 6 members and a focus on damaging and stunning enemies, making them frail and ineffective to stun immunity. They're primarily an alternative to Goblins to sacrifice and power up El Bandolero when a slightly sturdier option with some utility is appreciated, but as a result, should not be heavily invested in and likely won't make the cut for Wishlist. <br><br><strong>Pros:</strong><ul><li>6 member population and Hunter Faction can make them a neat side-grade of Goblins as a sacrificial unit to power up El Bandolero.</li><li>Permanent Attack Speed and Movement Speed debuff after stunning an enemy can cripple Melee units.</li></ul><strong>Cons:</strong><ul><li>Won't die immediately like Goblins due to higher HP, which is usually a bigger need to get El Bandolero's boost as soon as possible for modes such as Adventure.</li><li>Skills are built around stunning, making them weak against any kind of stun immunity.</li><li>Lower population count than Goblins' 8 members makes them difficult to justify without some investment to properly differentiate them.</li></ul><strong>Pairs well with:</strong><ul><li><strong>El Bandolero:</strong>If you need an option over Goblin to delay El Bandolero's invincibility and attack speed boost.</li></ul><strong>Does poorly against:</strong><ul><li><strong>Stun Immunity: </strong>Spirited Tiger protects all allies in an area and Armored Troll naturally has stun protection. When Dakini can't stun, their potential is severely hurt.</li><li><strong>Area of Effect Damage:</strong>Units like Werewolf and Swashbuckler that can hit multiple units with high damaging attacks can quickly kill off Dakini before they get a chance to cause much damage, at which point, you may as well have run Goblins.</li></ul>
